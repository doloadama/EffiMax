# EffiMax

EffiMax is a production process optimization software that aims to maximize efficiency and productivity in manufacturing operations. It provides tools and algorithms to identify bottlenecks, reduce waste, and optimize various parameters for improved production outcomes.

## Features

- Data processing and cleaning: EffiMax includes modules to preprocess and clean production data, ensuring high-quality input for optimization algorithms.
- Optimization algorithms: EffiMax implements various optimization algorithms, such as linear programming, nonlinear optimization, and metaheuristic algorithms, tailored to specific production process optimization use cases.
- User interaction: The software provides a web-based interface powered by Flask, allowing users to interact with the optimization software, input data, and receive optimization results.
- Data analysis and modeling: EffiMax leverages libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and NumPy for data analysis, predictive modeling, and statistical analysis as needed.
- Visualization: The software offers visualization capabilities using Matplotlib or Plotly to present optimization results, production data, and relevant metrics in a visual format.
